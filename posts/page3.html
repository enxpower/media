  <p class="preview">The coke is used in what’s known as ​“integrated” steelmaking. Coke is combined with iron ore and limestone in a scorching-hot blast furnace to produce iron. The molten metal is then moved into a basic oxygen furnace where it becomes steel — the essential and abundant material used in bridges, buildings, ships, cars, and household appliances.</p>
