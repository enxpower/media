  <p class="preview">After writing about Tesla’s 10% drop in sales in the UK despite the UK EV market rising 24%, and BYD passing up Tesla in the UK in annual sales last year, a reader pointed out some extra jaw-dropping stats. The reader, “manes,” posted the numbers for Tesla in Germany in the past 5 years. If you get nauseous looking at gory scenes, turn away now. Here’s what “manes” shared:</p>
