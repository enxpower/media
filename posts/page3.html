  <p class="preview">Last summer I did something very ambitious. I DIY-installed a ductless heat pump system almost completely solo. And it wasn’t just one simple ductless system, it was five indoor ductless heat pumps (3 of them on a second floor) and two outdoor units. I’d never done anything like it before, but wanted to try out how accessible heat pumps are for the DIYer and how much money we c...</p>
