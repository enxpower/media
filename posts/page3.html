  <p class="preview">This analysis and news roundup comes from the Canary Media Weekly newsletter. Sign up to get it every Friday. This week, the Trump administration announced its most ambitious pro-coal plans yet — a multipronged effort to resuscitate the industry, despite the financial, health, and climate case against doing so.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive plan to support the coal industry, including a $625 million investment from the Department of Energy to sustain coal power plants, the opening of 13 million acres of federal land for coal mining, and delays in EPA deadlines regarding wastewater pollution from coal plants. This initiative aims to keep aging coal plants operational, potentially costing consumers up to $6 billion annually, despite the availability of cheaper renewable energy alternatives. The administration&#x27;s actions also seek to roll back regulations on coal plant wastewater, ignoring the significant health and climate impacts associated with coal energy." data-summary-zh="特朗普政府宣布了一项全面计划，以支持煤炭行业，包括能源部投资6.25亿美元以维持煤电厂运营，开放1300万英亩联邦土地用于煤矿开采，以及推迟环保局关于煤电厂废水污染的截止日期。该计划旨在使老旧煤电厂继续运营，可能每年使消费者承担高达60亿美元的费用，尽管可再生能源替代方案更为便宜。政府的行动还试图放宽对煤电厂废水的监管，忽视了煤炭能源对健康和气候的重大影响。">The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive plan to support the coal industry, including a $625 million investment from the Department of Energy to sustain coal power plants, the opening of 13 million acres of federal land for coal mining, and delays in EPA deadlines regarding wastewater pollution from coal plants.
