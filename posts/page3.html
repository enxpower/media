  <p class="preview">Agrivoltaics have been the name of the game in the past few years in the solar power industry. On the surface, it seems simple — find farmland that could benefit from co-location with solar power plants, and then plop some solar panels on areas of the land that seem most suitable for solar without interfering with farming activities.
