  <p class="preview">The world’s leading battery producer, CATL, has decided to flex some of its robot muscles this month. It has revealed the first humanoid robot battery production line…. That is, a battery production line “manned” by humanoid robots. First of all, yes, these humanoid robots have apparently replaced human workers. In fact, one robot’s daily workload is reportedly triple that of a human worker….</p>

  <p class="preview">Cities face unique vulnerabilities when it comes to grid planning. With densely concentrated energy demand and highly interdependent infrastructure systems, even a single failure can propagate rapidly. This is why cities are turning to microgrids: localized systems that generate and manage energy closer to the point of consumption, reducing reliance on distant transmission infr...</p>
