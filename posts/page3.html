  <p class="preview">If the new “OBBA” tax law was intended to dampen the enthusiasm for EVs in the US, it’s a day late and a dollar short. Despite the potential for a short term disruption, the long term momentum is on the side of EVs. One good example is the fleet electrification movement, where fleet owners continue to plan ahead for zero emission mobility, automakers continue to respond with mo...</p>

Yes, you read that correctly. After decades of framing gas as a so-called “bridge fuel” to a renewable future, the argument has seemingly flipped on its head. We are...</p>
