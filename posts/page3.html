  <p class="preview">U.S. imports of biodiesel and renewable diesel significantly decreased in the first half of 2025 (1H25) compared with the same period in previous years. This decline is primarily due to the loss of tax credits for imported biofuels and generally lower domestic consumption of these fuels.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="In 2025, U.S. imports of biodiesel and renewable diesel are expected to decline significantly due to changes in tax credits. The reduction in imports is attributed to the expiration of the federal biodiesel tax credit, which has historically supported the industry." data-summary-zh="2025年，美国生物柴油和可再生柴油的进口预计将大幅下降，原因是税收抵免的变化。进口减少归因于联邦生物柴油税收抵免的到期，该抵免历来支持该行业。">In 2025, U.S. imports of biodiesel and renewable diesel are expected to decline significantly due to changes in tax credits.
