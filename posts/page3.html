  <p class="preview">Abstract: Improving the operating temperature of the solar receiver can enhance power cycle efficiency in solar power towers by raising the turbine-inlet temperature. However, maintaining high efficiency and safety at ultra-high temperatures (&gt;1573 K) remains challenging. Therefore, this work focuses on the design and optimization of an oval tungsten solar receiver. Firstly, the receiver performan</p>
