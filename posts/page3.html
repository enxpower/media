  <p class="preview">Energy storage is a thing that exists in space and time, though you wouldn’t know it from the recent remarks of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who is apparently unaware of such things. Nevertheless, batteries do exist, they are routinely used for squirreling away large quantities of wind and solar energy, and the technology is continuing to evolve in support of grid efficiency...</p>

The same guy who bought it, Kyle, just got another really cheap used electric vehicle — this time a Toyota RAV4 EV. There weren’t a lot of these EVs made and they go back quite a while. Many of them were in California. I used to see them once in a while. Of course, I wanted one because they ...</p>
