  <p class="preview">TL;DR: Fossil narratives are collapsing. Economics, physics, and real-world deployment all now point one way: solar + storage. For several decades now, the fossil lobby has followed the renewable sector like a bad debt — constantly painting molehills as mountains, inventing false comparisons, and trying to derail public understanding any which way it can. Even the COP process has not been spared.</p>
