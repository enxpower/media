  <p class="preview">Abstract: The use of renewable energy in the context of green hydrogen production requires suitable energy storage technologies to compensate for intermittent wind and solar resources. High-temperature electrolysis is a promising way to produce hydrogen as it has the highest electrical efficiency by using steam instead of liquid water compared to low temperature electrolysis. Here, […] The post Pu</p>
