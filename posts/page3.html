  <p class="preview">Clean energy is starting to bend the curve on China’s fossil-fuel use. Overall, carbon-free sources met more than 80% of China’s new electricity demand last year — a marked difference from recent years. Between 2011 and 2020, they met less than half of new demand, according to a new report from think tank Ember.</p>
