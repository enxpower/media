  <p class="preview">The Trump Administration is waging an unprecedented, cross-agency campaign to restrict clean energy deployment. Between the upending of tax policy, new punitive, anti-solar regulation, and an unabashed pro-fossil fuels agenda, this administration is creating instability that is scaring off investors, weakening grid reliability, and driving up electricity prices. At the same time the ... [continued</p>

  <p class="preview">Abstract: Currently the thermal effect of light has received extensive attention in the field of concentrating solar power gasification, but the non-thermal effect of light has been neglected. In this study, a high-flux solar simulator was coupled with a thermogravimetric analyzer and the thermal effects of concentrating solar power were effectively controlled.
