  <p class="preview">The Promise Of A New Solar Revolution Most Americans love the idea of going solar. Few can actually do it. Traditional rooftop solar has helped millions cut bills and emissions, but it leaves most of the country behind — renters, apartment dwellers, low-income families, and anyone whose roof is too shady, too old, or too expensive to replace.</p>
