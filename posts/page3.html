  <p class="preview">The utility industry is facing a pivotal moment: the legacy platforms that enable time-division multiplexing (TDM) are reaching end-of-life. These systems have become increasingly unsustainable due to rising costs and vendor support issues, and they can’t support advanced applications like IEC 61850 automation, advanced cybersecurity, smart devices or the integration of distributed energy resource</p>
