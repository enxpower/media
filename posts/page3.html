  <p class="preview">Energy storage is a thing that exists in space and time, though you wouldn’t know it from the recent remarks of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who is apparently unaware of such things. Nevertheless, batteries do exist, they are routinely used for squirreling away large quantities of wind and solar energy, and the technology is continuing to evolve in support of grid efficiency...</p>
