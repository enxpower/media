  <p class="preview">Abstract: Decarbonisation of the energy sector is critical for climate change mitigation, with the power sector remaining a major contributor to global emissions. Concentrating solar power (CSP) technology combined with thermal energy storage (TES) presents a promising solution to overcome this challenge. TES systems, particularly those utilising phase change materials (PCMs), offer efficient ener</p>
