  <p class="preview">Air pollution might be somewhat of a difficult topic for the public to understand fully because it’s not only what we see with our eyes. The obvious signs are smoke coming from tailpipes and smokestacks or offensive smells or wildfire smoke and haze. We can also sometimes see smog, but at other times air pollution might be present and it looks like fog or we can’t see it at all...</p>
