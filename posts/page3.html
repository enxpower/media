  <p class="preview">Abstract: Concentrated solar thermal (CST) systems, capable of driving high-temperature processes up to 2000 K, hold significant potential for chemical and industrial applications. This paper reviews methods for measuring concentrated solar flux, focusing on their role in calculating key optical performance metrics such as concentration ratio and optical efficiency. It also explores the challenges</p>

  <p class="preview">U.S. imports of biodiesel and renewable diesel significantly decreased in the first half of 2025 (1H25) compared with the same period in previous years. This decline is primarily due to the loss of tax credits for imported biofuels and generally lower domestic consumption of these fuels.</p>
