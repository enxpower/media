US President Donald Trump is bending over backwards to make solar power less accessible here on Earth, but clever entrepreneurs are simply going behind his back to harvest it from outer space. The latest example is the California-based startup Aetherflux, which has zeroed in on the ability of space solar systems to skip the long wait times for a conventi...</p>
