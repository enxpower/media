  <p class="preview">Abstract: Carbon-neutral fuels are key to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. Solar redox cycles can produce them by creating oxygen vacancies in a metal oxide capable of splitting water and CO2. The resulting synthesis gas can be processed into a liquid fuel like methanol. To close the carbon cycle, feedstock CO2 can be captured from the atmosphere […] The post International Journal of Hydrogen </p>
