  <p class="preview">Hawaii has the highest rate of rooftop solar power adoption in the US, on a per capita basis. It makes sense, as the power grid is largely (~65%) powered by imported fossil energy sources and is therefore predictably very expensive, at 42+ cents per kilowatt-hour. That makes rooftop solar a ... [continued] The post Hawaii Hits Milestone in Rooftop Solar appeared first on CleanTechnica .</p>
