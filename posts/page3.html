  <p class="preview">Cities face unique vulnerabilities when it comes to grid planning. With densely concentrated energy demand and highly interdependent infrastructure systems, even a single failure can propagate rapidly. This is why cities are turning to microgrids: localized systems that generate and manage energy closer to the point of consumption, reducing reliance on distant transmission infr...</p>
