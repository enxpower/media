  <p class="preview">Instead of absorbing energy from the sun to produce electricity, a new class of devices generates power by absorbing heat from its surroundings and beaming it at outer space. Such devices, which do not require exotic materials as their predecessors did, could help ventilate greenhouses and homes, researchers say. In 2014, scientists invented superthin materials that can cool bu...</p>
