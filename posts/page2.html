  <p class="preview">In 1950, the English mathematician Alan Turing devised what he called “the imitation game.” Later dubbed the Turing test, the experiment asks a human participant to conduct a conversation with an unknown partner and try to determine if it’s a computer or a person on the other end of the line. If the person can’t figure it out, the machine passes the Turing test. Power grid oper...</p>
