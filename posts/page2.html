  <p class="preview">It’s clear as day: gallium nitride’s (GaN’s) role in photovoltaic microinverters is growing—but will this wide-bandgap (WBG) material ultimately dislodge silicon as the most widely used semiconductor in panel-level DC to AC conversion? In this article, we will provide a brief overview of some of the key concepts in this area, and some of the recent updates from major players.</p>

That’s not bad, but it’s still about six times as long as it takes to fill the tank of an ordinary petrol-powered vehicle. One of the major bottlenecks to even faster charging is cooling, specifically uneven cooling inside big EV battery packs as the pack is charged. Hydr...</p>
