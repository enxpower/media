  <p class="preview">Since 2021, electricity demand within the Texas electricity grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has steadily increased. In the first nine months of 2025, electricity demand in ERCOT, which manages about 90% of the state&#x27;s load, reached a record high compared with the same period in previous years. Over those same months, ERCOT had the fastest electricity demand growt</p>
