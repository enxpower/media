  <p class="preview">Industry claims, often echoed by governments to justify airport expansion, that more flights benefit the economy, undermined by new research. The first ever Europe-wide analysis investigating the link between the growth in air transport and economic growth has found industry claims that economic growth is driven by increased air connectivity, such as airport expansion, are deeply flawed.</p>
