  <p class="preview">Rooftop solar and home batteries are way more expensive in the U.S. than in most countries, largely due to slow and burdensome local permitting and utility interconnection processes. But there are tools installers can use to bring down these so-called ​“soft costs,” which make up about two-thirds of the price of installing solar, batteries, and EV chargers in the U.S.</p>
