  <p class="preview">Tesla CEO Elon Musk threw shade at Waymo for having “rookie numbers” amid Tesla’s own disappointing autonomous-driving performance, raising the question: Is Elon Musk delusional or simply lying about Tesla’s Full Self-Driving? Every year since 2018, Musk has alternately claimed that Tesla would solve self-driving “by the end of the year” or “next year.”</p>
