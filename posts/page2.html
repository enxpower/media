  <p class="preview">Hawaii is re-evaluating its electricity system again and LNG is back on the table as a proposed bridge between oil dependence and a renewable future. The idea is simple at first glance. Hawaii burns more oil for electricity than any other state and Oahu still relies on oil for most of its generation. LNG is cleaner than residual fuel oil at the smokestack and often cheaper per ...</p>
