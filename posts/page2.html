That’s the topline takeaway from the annual bacchanalia of renewables called RE+, held this year in Las Vegas, Nevada, where tens of thousands of people sought refuge from the scorching desert sun and endless casino floors last week to figure out what’s next.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="At the RE+ event in Las Vegas, Wood Mackenzie&#x27;s Vice Chairman Chris Seiple highlighted the unstoppable momentum of the clean energy industry, despite challenges from previous administrations. U.S. utilities have committed to or are constructing 116 gigawatts (GW) of large load capacity, representing 15.5% of current peak demand, while the solar industry added nearly 18 GW of new capacity in the first half of 2025, with solar and storage making up 82% of that growth." data-summary-zh="在拉斯维加斯的RE+活动上，伍德麦肯齐副主席克里斯·塞普尔强调了清洁能源行业不可阻挡的势头，尽管面临来自前任政府的挑战。美国公用事业公司已承诺或正在建设116吉瓦（GW）的负载容量，占当前峰值需求的15.5%，而太阳能行业在2025年上半年新增近18 GW的容量，其中太阳能和储能占82%。">At the RE+ event in Las Vegas, Wood Mackenzie&#x27;s Vice Chairman Chris Seiple highlighted the unstoppable momentum of the clean energy industry, despite challenges from previous administrations.
