  <p class="preview">China’s coal consumption dropped by about 2.6% in the first six months of 2025 while electricity demand rose roughly 5% compared with the same period in 2024. That means China added solar and wind capacity fast enough to cover new demand and then some. U.S. coal fired electricity jumped 14% ...
