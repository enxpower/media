  <p class="preview">Methane is a greenhouse gas “super-pollutant” that is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over 20 years. We can manage what we measure, but when it comes to methane emissions, we come up painfully short: most national databases, including the United States, are significantly underreporting those emissions. This gap calls for a better understanding […] The post Measuring Methane: State Actions</p>
