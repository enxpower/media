  <p class="preview">See more from Canary Media’s ​“Chart of the week” column. The world is clamoring for more electrons. It’s getting them from solar and wind. Between January and September, the two clean-energy sources grew fast enough to more than offset all new demand worldwide, according to data from energy research firm Ember.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="Between January and September, solar and wind energy sources grew sufficiently to exceed new global power demand, which rose by 603 terawatt-hours compared to the previous year. Solar alone accounted for 498 TWh of this demand, while wind contributed 137 TWh. As a result, fossil-fuel generation decreased by 17 TWh through Q3, with expectations that this trend will continue into 2025." data-summary-zh="从1月到9月，太阳能和风能的增长足以超过全球新的电力需求，电力需求比去年同期增加了603太瓦时。太阳能单独满足了498太瓦时的需求，而风能贡献了137太瓦时。因此，化石燃料发电在第三季度减少了17太瓦时，预计这一趋势将持续到2025年。">Between January and September, solar and wind energy sources grew sufficiently to exceed new global power demand, which rose by 603 terawatt-hours compared to the previous year.
