  <p class="preview">In 2025, despite no hurricanes making landfall in the Southeast U.S., extreme weather events continue to threaten power infrastructure. Utilities face increasing outages and damages, necessitating a shift from manual, reactive responses to AI-driven, proactive storm management strategies that enhance resilience and reduce downtime.</p>

  <p class="preview">If you’ve covered e-bikes as long as I have, you’ll know two things about them: they’re an awesome way to get around, and the basic technology behind an e-bike motor hasn’t radically changed in a long, long time. However, based on the new e-bike motor design I just tested from a powertrain technology company called CHARGE, the e-bike world may be about to get turned on its head...</p>
