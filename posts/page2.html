  <p class="preview">From pv magazine Australia Independent energy research company Rystad Energy has released analysis of the federal government’s Solar Sharer scheme, which will give households three free hours of electricity during the middle of the day from July 2026.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="Rystad Energy&#x27;s analysis of Australia&#x27;s Solar Sharer scheme indicates that the initiative, which provides households with three free hours of electricity during the day starting July 2026, could diminish the investment case for utility batteries. The scheme aims to shift demand to daytime when renewable generation is highest, but it may lead to increased prices during non-daylight hours and impact the economics of utility storage, as demand for utility solar and wind could rise while peaking technologies like gas and batteries may suffer." data-summary-zh="Rystad Energy对澳大利亚Solar Sharer计划的分析表明，该计划将于2026年7月开始为家庭提供每天三小时的免费电力，可能会削弱对公用事业电池的投资案例。该计划旨在将需求转移到白天，当时可再生能源发电最高，但可能导致非白天时段价格上涨，并影响公用事业储能的经济性，因为公用事业太阳能和风能的需求可能上升，而峰值技术如天然气和电池可能受到影响。">Rystad Energy&#x27;s analysis of Australia&#x27;s Solar Sharer scheme indicates that the initiative, which provides households with three free hours of electricity during the day starting July 2026, could diminish the investment case for utility batteries.
