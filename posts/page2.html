  <p class="preview">As long as I’ve been covering electric vehicles, there’s been a debate about how useful (or not) plugin hybrid electric vehicles are. This week, two reader comments show that the debate rages on. First of all, we received the following comment from Tom Dillon via our contact form: “A few days ago you had an article about how plug-in hybrids are not getting anywhere close to the...</p>
