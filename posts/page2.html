  <p class="preview">We expect energy expenditures this winter will vary based on a home&#x27;s main space heating fuel: homes heating with natural gas will pay about the same amount for natural gas as they did last winter, but homes heating with electricity will pay more than they did last winter. Homes heating with propane or heating oil will pay less than they did last winter.</p>
