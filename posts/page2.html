  <p class="preview">The firm said it had lowered its expectations for 2025 slightly due to the on-again, off-again US tariffs against trading partners, particularly China, and changes in US policy direction ushered in with the second Trump presidency. However, those headwinds are likely insufficient to blow the global industry off course from a record-breaking year.</p>

The investment tax credit and production tax credit for energy storage were retained in recent legislation, mitigating potential declines in US installations. Growth is also expected from markets outside the US and China, with significant contributions from Germany, the UK, Australia, and others, leading to a projected cumulative installed capacity of 2TW/7.3TWh by the mid-2030s." data-summary-zh="BNEF预测，尽管由于美国关税和政策变化略微降低了预期，全球能源存储部署仍有望在2025年创下纪录。近期立法保留了能源存储的投资税收抵免和生产税收抵免，减轻了美国安装量可能下降的影响。预计美国和中国以外的市场也将贡献显著增长，德国、英国、澳大利亚等国将发挥重要作用，预计到2030年代中期，全球累计装机容量将达到2TW/7.3TWh。">BNEF forecasts that global energy storage deployments are on track for a record year in 2025, despite slight reductions in expectations due to US tariffs and policy changes.
