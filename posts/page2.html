  <p class="preview">The US solar industry hit a speed bump this year due to the abrupt shift in federal energy policy. Shift or not, though, the fact remains that solar is the fastest and most economical way to add more electricity to the nation’s grid. That holds true across the US regardless of partisan politics.
