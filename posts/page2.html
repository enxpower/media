  <p class="preview">Abstract: Concentrated solar power integrated with the calcium looping process enables dispatchable power generation. However, from an equipment perspective, various challenges such as high energy demand of CO2 compressors and the immaturity of solid–solid heat exchangers impede the application of such a system. In the present work, an integrated system incorporating concentrated solar power and [</p>
