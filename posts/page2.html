  <p class="preview">Agrivoltaics is the combination of solar and farming. Now, farming is a pretty broad topic that encompasses both crops and animals, but no matter what form it takes, it basically comes down to turning sunlight into food. Some crops are consumed by humans, others are consumed by animals who then become food for humans. Either way, combining solar and farming is a match made in h...</p>
