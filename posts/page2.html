  <div class="meta"><span class="source">Today in Energy</span> | <span class="date">Mon, 5 Jan 2026 09:00:00 EST</span></div>
  <p class="preview">Crude oil prices generally declined in 2025 with supplies in the global crude oil market exceeding demand. Crude oil inventory builds in China muted some of the price decline. Events such as Israel&#x27;s June 13 strikes on Iran and attacks between Russia and Ukraine targeting oil infrastructure periodically supported prices.</p>
