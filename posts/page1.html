  <div class="meta"><span class="source">Today in Energy</span> | <span class="date">Wed, 10 Dec 2025 09:00:00 EST</span></div>
  <p class="preview">Critical minerals, such as copper, cobalt, and silicon, are vital for energy technologies, but most critical minerals markets are less transparent than mature energy markets, such as crude oil or coal. Like other energy markets, many supply-side and demand-side factors influence pricing for these energy-relevant critical minerals, but critical minerals supply chains contain numerous data gaps.</p>
