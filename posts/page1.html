  <p class="preview">AI data centers could flood the overtaxed U.S. power grid with demand and further drive up energy costs for consumers. Or, they could simply agree to use less electricity during the handful of hours per year when the grid is under the greatest stress, making it possible for tech companies to get the power they need without straining the system.
