  <p class="preview">CES 2026 in Las Vegas has been dominated by two things: the next generation of AI compute and a sudden explosion of credible humanoid robots. While Tesla isn’t officially exhibiting on the floor, Elon Musk has been actively monitoring the event from X. His reactions, and lack thereof, to the major announcements give us a fascinating look into how Tesla views the rapidly crowding field of autonomy.</p>
