  <div class="meta"><span class="source">Today in Energy</span> | <span class="date">Wed, 10 Dec 2025 09:00:00 EST</span></div>
  <p class="preview">Critical minerals, such as copper, cobalt, and silicon, are vital for energy technologies, but most critical minerals markets are less transparent than mature energy markets, such as crude oil or coal. Like other energy markets, many supply-side and demand-side factors influence pricing for these energy-relevant critical minerals, but critical minerals supply chains contain numerous data gaps.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="The Energy Minerals Observatory highlights significant data deficits in critical supply chains for energy minerals. These gaps hinder the understanding of resource availability and the dynamics of supply chains essential for energy transition and technology development." data-summary-zh="能源矿产观察站强调了能源矿产关键供应链中存在的重大数据缺口。这些缺口阻碍了对资源可用性和能源转型及技术发展所需供应链动态的理解。">The Energy Minerals Observatory highlights significant data deficits in critical supply chains for energy minerals.
