  <p class="preview">Panel upgrade; via QMerit. Adding a rooftop solar array to your home or business can be exciting and expensive. As such, it might be tempting to cut corners to keep costs down — but some upgrades are simply much cheaper to do while your solar system is being installed than they are to add later, and we’ve got some prime examples right here.</p>
