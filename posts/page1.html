  <p class="preview">Critical minerals, such as copper, cobalt, and silicon, are vital for energy technologies, but most critical minerals markets are less transparent than mature energy markets, such as crude oil or coal. Like other energy markets, many supply-side and demand-side factors influence pricing for these energy-relevant critical minerals, but critical minerals supply chains contain numerous data gaps.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="The Energy Minerals Observatory highlights significant data deficits in critical supply chains for energy minerals. These gaps in information can hinder effective decision-making and policy development in the energy sector." data-summary-zh="能源矿产观察站强调了能源矿产关键供应链中存在的重大数据缺口。这些信息的缺失可能会妨碍能源部门有效的决策和政策制定。">The Energy Minerals Observatory highlights significant data deficits in critical supply chains for energy minerals.
