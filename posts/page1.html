  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="Australia has achieved a significant milestone in its clean energy transition with five large-scale battery storage projects equipped with grid-forming inverters now connected to the National Energy Market (NEM), and three more expected to come online within the next year. These batteries are not only storing excess renewable energy but also stabilizing the grid, marking a shift in their role from support to central players in maintaining system strength.
