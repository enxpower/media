  <p class="preview">Critical minerals, such as copper, cobalt, and silicon, are vital for energy technologies, but most critical minerals markets are less transparent than mature energy markets, such as crude oil or coal. Like other energy markets, many supply-side and demand-side factors influence pricing for these energy-relevant critical minerals, but critical minerals supply chains contain numerous data gaps.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="The Energy Minerals Observatory highlights significant data deficits in critical supply chains for energy minerals. These gaps hinder effective decision-making and policy development in the energy sector, particularly regarding the sourcing and sustainability of essential minerals." data-summary-zh="能源矿产观察所强调了能源矿产关键供应链中存在的重大数据缺口。这些缺口妨碍了能源部门在重要矿产的采购和可持续性方面的有效决策和政策制定。">The Energy Minerals Observatory highlights significant data deficits in critical supply chains for energy minerals.
