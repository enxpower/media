  <p class="preview">Booming data center growth and sluggish power plant construction are driving up electricity costs in the country’s biggest energy market. On Wednesday, PJM Interconnection announced the results of its latest capacity auction, which sets the price of resources needed to meet peak power demands for a grid serving more than 65 million people in 13 states and Washington, D.C.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="PJM Interconnection has reported record capacity costs of $16.4 billion for the 2027-2028 period, driven by rising electricity demand from data centers and slow power plant construction. This increase, up from $16.1 billion in July, is expected to raise utility bills for some customers by 1.5% to 5% starting June 2026. PJM also failed to secure enough resources to meet its 20% reserve margin target, highlighting ongoing challenges in balancing supply and demand in the energy market." data-summary-zh="PJM互联公司报告称，2027-2028年度的容量成本创下164亿美元的纪录，主要受到数据中心电力需求上升和发电厂建设缓慢的推动。这一增长较7月份的161亿美元有所上升，预计将导致部分客户的公用事业账单在2026年6月起上涨1.5%至5%。PJM还未能确保足够的资源以满足20%的储备边际目标，突显了能源市场在供需平衡方面面临的持续挑战。">PJM Interconnection has reported record capacity costs of $16.4 billion for the 2027-2028 period, driven by rising electricity demand from data centers and slow power plant construction.
