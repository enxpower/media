  <p class="preview">Critical minerals, such as copper, cobalt, and silicon, are vital for energy technologies, but most critical minerals markets are less transparent than mature energy markets, such as crude oil or coal. Like other energy markets, many supply-side and demand-side factors influence pricing for these energy-relevant critical minerals, but critical minerals supply chains contain numerous data gaps.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="The Energy Minerals Observatory highlights significant data deficits in critical supply chains for energy minerals. These gaps in data can hinder effective decision-making and policy development in the energy sector, impacting the transition to cleaner energy sources." data-summary-zh="能源矿产观察站强调了能源矿产关键供应链中存在的重大数据缺口。这些数据缺口可能会妨碍能源部门有效决策和政策制定，影响向清洁能源的转型。">The Energy Minerals Observatory highlights significant data deficits in critical supply chains for energy minerals.
