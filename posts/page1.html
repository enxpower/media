  <p class="preview">For many homeowners, the conversation about adding rooftop solar panels starts with cutting utility bills — but there are plenty of other reasons to make the switch. One of them is that adding a home solar system could actually increase your home’s resale value … but is that true? The short answer is: yes (kinda).</p>
