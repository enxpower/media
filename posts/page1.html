  <p class="preview">Abstract: The two-step solar-thermochemical cycle process for water splitting is a promising technology for hydrogen generation with very high theoretical efficiencies. This study investigates the operational behavior of a prototype solar reactor with thermal power of 250 kW. A multi-physical reactor model is used for analyzing the dynamical process behavior of the reactor’s porous metal […] The p</p>
