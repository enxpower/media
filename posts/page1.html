  <p class="preview">The cost of keeping California’s power grid up and running is skyrocketing, and in turn, so are households’ energy bills. Virtual power plants, which harness the combined power of lots of rooftop solar systems, home batteries, EVs, and smart-home appliances, can help — especially if utilities use them to relieve pressure at counterintuitive ​“sweet spots” on the grid.
