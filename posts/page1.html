  <p class="preview">The average number of active rigs per month that are drilling for oil and natural gas in the U.S. Lower 48 states has declined steadily over the past few years from a recent peak of 750 rigs in December 2022 to 517 rigs this October. The declining rig count reflects operators&#x27; responses to declining crude oil and natural gas prices and improvements in drilling efficiencies.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="U.S. rig counts have remained low, with the number of active drilling rigs decreasing to 750 as of mid-October 2023. This decline is attributed to improved production efficiencies in the oil and gas sector, allowing companies to maintain output with fewer rigs." data-summary-zh="截至2023年10月中旬，美国活跃钻井平台数量降至750个，保持低位。这一下降归因于石油和天然气行业生产效率的提高，使公司能够以更少的钻机维持产量。">U.S. rig counts have remained low, with the number of active drilling rigs decreasing to 750 as of mid-October 2023.
