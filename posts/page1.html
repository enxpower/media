  <p class="preview">One of the biggest unanswered questions for many folks considering an e-bike isn’t how a bike rides on day one, but rather how it holds up after years of daily use. Reviews and first impressions are everywhere, but genuine long-term ownership stories are surprisingly rare. That’s why a recent shared case from a rider who just crossed 10,000 miles (16,000 km) on their e-bike cau...</p>
