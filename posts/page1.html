  <p class="preview">Ferrari has released details about its approach to powertrain sounds with its first electric vehicle, the Elettrica, and I am intrigued. If well-executed, I even think it might convince some petrolheads to give EVs a try. In short, Ferrari is rejecting fake engine noise for its first EV and opts for an ‘authentic’ yet improved electric powertrain sound directly generated by the electric motors.</p>
