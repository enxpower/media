  <p class="preview">Abstract: Mixed chloride salts and mixed carbonates are ideal thermal storage materials for future high-temperature concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. However, due to the strong corrosiveness and poor thermal capacity of chloride salts as well as high material costs of carbonates, these two types of molten salts are not suitable for large-scale thermal energy storage […] The post Published at </p>
