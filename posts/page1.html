  <p class="preview">See more from Canary Media’s ​“Chart of the week” column. It sure looks like the Trump administration is not going to let any coal plants close down during its term — no matter the cost to consumers and to the climate.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="The Trump administration is attempting to prevent the closure of coal power plants, with 27 gigawatts of coal capacity set to retire in the U.S. by 2028, representing about 15% of the current coal fleet. Since 2011, over 140 gigawatts of coal plants have retired, contributing to a decline in carbon emissions, while renewable energy sources have gained prominence. The administration&#x27;s actions may lead to significant additional costs for consumers, with estimates suggesting up to $100 million for just the continued operation of the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan." data-summary-zh="特朗普政府试图阻止煤电厂的关闭，预计到2028年，美国将有27吉瓦的煤电容量退役，占当前煤电机组的约15%。自2011年以来，已有超过140吉瓦的煤电厂退役，导致碳排放下降，而可再生能源的使用逐渐增加。政府的这一举措可能导致消费者面临显著的额外成本，仅密歇根州的J.H.
