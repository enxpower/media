  <p class="preview">The average number of active rigs per month that are drilling for oil and natural gas in the U.S. Lower 48 states has declined steadily over the past few years from a recent peak of 750 rigs in December 2022 to 517 rigs this October. The declining rig count reflects operators&#x27; responses to declining crude oil and natural gas prices and improvements in drilling efficiencies.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="U.S. rig counts have remained low, with the number of active drilling rigs at 1,050 as of October 2023. This decline is attributed to improved production efficiencies in the oil and gas sector, allowing for increased output without the need for more rigs." data-summary-zh="截至2023年10月，美国活跃钻井平台数量保持在1,050个，数量较低。这一下降归因于石油和天然气行业的生产效率提高，使得在不增加钻井平台的情况下也能提高产量。">U.S. rig counts have remained low, with the number of active drilling rigs at 1,050 as of October 2023.
