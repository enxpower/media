On Wednesday, PJM Interconnection announced the results of its latest capacity auction, which sets the price of resources needed to meet peak power demands for a grid serving more than 65 million people in 13 states and Washington, D.C.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="PJM Interconnection reported record capacity costs of $16.4 billion for the 2027-2028 period, driven by increased demand from data centers and slow power plant construction. This marks an increase from $16.1 billion in July and $14.7 billion in 2024, contributing to expected utility bill hikes of 1.5% to 5% for some customers starting June 2026. PJM also failed to meet its 20% reserve margin target, highlighting ongoing challenges in balancing electricity supply and demand." data-summary-zh="PJM互联公司报告称，2027-2028年度的容量成本创下164亿美元的纪录，主要受到数据中心需求增加和电厂建设缓慢的推动。这一数字较7月份的161亿美元和2024年的147亿美元有所上升，预计将导致部分客户在2026年6月起的电费上涨1.5%至5%。PJM还未能满足20%的备用容量目标，突显了电力供需平衡的持续挑战。">PJM Interconnection reported record capacity costs of $16.4 billion for the 2027-2028 period, driven by increased demand from data centers and slow power plant construction.
