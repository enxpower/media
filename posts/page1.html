  <p class="preview">Abstract: Currently the thermal effect of light has received extensive attention in the field of concentrating solar power gasification, but the non-thermal effect of light has been neglected. In this study, a high-flux solar simulator was coupled with a thermogravimetric analyzer and the thermal effects of concentrating solar power were effectively controlled. The non-thermal effect […] The post </p>
