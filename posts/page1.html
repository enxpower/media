  <p class="preview">The average number of active rigs per month that are drilling for oil and natural gas in the U.S. Lower 48 states has declined steadily over the past few years from a recent peak of 750 rigs in December 2022 to 517 rigs this October. The declining rig count reflects operators&#x27; responses to declining crude oil and natural gas prices and improvements in drilling efficiencies.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="U.S. rig counts have remained low, with the number of active drilling rigs decreasing as production efficiencies improve. This trend indicates that oil and gas companies are able to produce more with fewer rigs, reflecting advancements in technology and operational practices." data-summary-zh="美国钻井平台数量保持低位，随着生产效率的提高，活跃钻井平台数量减少。这一趋势表明，石油和天然气公司能够以更少的钻井平台生产更多，反映了技术和运营实践的进步。">U.S. rig counts have remained low, with the number of active drilling rigs decreasing as production efficiencies improve.
