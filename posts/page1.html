  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="PJM Interconnection has reported record capacity costs of $16.4 billion for the 2027-2028 period, driven by increasing electricity demand from data centers and slow power plant construction. This marks a rise from $16.1 billion in July and $14.7 billion in 2024, with utility bills expected to increase by 1.5% to 5% for some customers starting June 2026. PJM also failed to secure enough resources to meet its 20% reserve margin, highlighting ongoing challenges in balancing supply and demand in the energy market." data-summary-zh="PJM互联公司报告称，2027-2028年度的容量成本创下164亿美元的记录，主要受到数据中心电力需求增加和发电厂建设缓慢的推动。这一数字较7月份的161亿美元和2024年的147亿美元有所上升，预计到2026年6月，一些客户的公用事业账单将上涨1.5%至5%。PJM还未能确保足够的资源以满足20%的储备边际，突显了能源市场在供需平衡方面面临的持续挑战。">PJM Interconnection has reported record capacity costs of $16.4 billion for the 2027-2028 period, driven by increasing electricity demand from data centers and slow power plant construction.
