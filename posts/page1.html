  <div class="meta"><span class="source">Today in Energy</span> | <span class="date">Mon, 5 Jan 2026 09:00:00 EST</span></div>
  <p class="preview">Crude oil prices generally declined in 2025 with supplies in the global crude oil market exceeding demand. Crude oil inventory builds in China muted some of the price decline. Events such as Israel&#x27;s June 13 strikes on Iran and attacks between Russia and Ukraine targeting oil infrastructure periodically supported prices.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="Crude oil prices decreased in 2025 due to an oversupply in the market. This decline reflects ongoing adjustments in global oil production and demand dynamics." data-summary-zh="由于市场供应过剩，2025年原油价格下降。这一下降反映了全球石油生产和需求动态的持续调整。">Crude oil prices decreased in 2025 due to an oversupply in the market.
