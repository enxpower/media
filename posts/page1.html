  <p class="preview">On the Monday before Thanksgiving, the U.S. retail price for regular-grade gasoline averaged $3.06 per gallon (gal), just 2 cents/gal higher than the same time last year. After adjusting for inflation, however, this year marks the lowest average gasoline price for the Monday before the Thanksgiving holiday weekend since 2020, when the pandemic disrupted gasoline demand and travel plans.</p>
  <p class="summary" data-summary-en="U.S. average gasoline prices this Thanksgiving are approximately the same as they were last year, reflecting stability in fuel costs during the holiday season. The Energy Information Administration reports that prices have remained relatively unchanged compared to 2022." data-summary-zh="美国今年感恩节的平均汽油价格与去年大致相同，反映出假期期间燃料成本的稳定。能源信息署报告称，与2022年相比，价格保持相对不变。">U.S. average gasoline prices this Thanksgiving are approximately the same as they were last year, reflecting stability in fuel costs during the holiday season.
