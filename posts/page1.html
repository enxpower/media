  <p class="preview">We’ve heard it before, that Elon Musk doesn’t want Tesla to ever make an electric motorcycle. But the polarizing CEO has taken to social media to explain why he still says it will never happen. As Musk confirmed, the issue isn’t that he doesn’t think Tesla could build an electric motorcycle, but rather that he doesn’t think they are safe to begin with.</p>
