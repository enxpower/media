  <p class="preview">Tesla is officially killing the option to purchase its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package upfront. CEO Elon Musk announced today that the automaker will stop selling FSD as a one-time option and will instead only offer it as a monthly subscription. It marks a massive shift in Tesla’s strategy for the software, which Musk has famously claimed for years would become an “appreciating asset.”</p>
