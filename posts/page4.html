Batteries store a lot of energy but deliver power more slowly, whereas supercapacitors can rapidly charge and discharge but don’t hold much energy. This is the case not only for larger bulk batteries and supercapacitors, but also at much smaller scales, with both microbatteries and microsuperca...</p>
