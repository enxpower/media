  <p class="preview">Last Updated on: In recent remarks, John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra Energy, laid out a curious and somewhat baffling narrative: renewables should serve as a transition solution toward expanding natural gas generation. Yes, you read that correctly. After decades of framing gas as a so-called ‚Äúbridge fuel‚Äù to a renewable future, the argument has seemingly flipped on its head. We are...</p>

  <p class="preview">Abstract: Mixed chloride salts and mixed carbonates are ideal thermal storage materials for future high-temperature concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. However, due to the strong corrosiveness and poor thermal capacity of chloride salts as well as high material costs of carbonates, these two types of molten salts are not suitable for large-scale thermal energy storage (TES) ...</p>
